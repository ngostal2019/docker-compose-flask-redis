# A simple Docker Compose Flask-Redis Application Built by Unixcloudtraining
## Note:
> This microservice simple app consists of 2 services:
1. Frontend:
    1. HTML: Frontend app to load the final web site
1. Backend:
    1. Redis: Remote Dictionary Server which is the bwill act as a cache memory
    1. Python: For computation & making requests to the Redis DB server
## Requirements
###
1. Docker engine & Docker compose
1. Python3.x
###
## Folder content
1. `index.html` is the front-end communicating with the `app.py` file.
1. `app.py` maps the application on port `8000` is the back-end logic responsible to pass data that have been processed and shared them \
with the `index.html` file it also gets the number of times the `POST` method was passed to to the `Redis DB` server.
1. The `requirements.txt` file has the necessary dependencies for the imported modules(`redis`, `flask`) in the `app.py` file.
1. `Dockerfile` exposes the application on port `5500` and contains the instructions to build the container image.
1. `.dockerignore` will be used by the docker engine to ignore files you don't want to be present in the container image
1. `.gitignore` is a list of files you don't want to appear in your repository.
1. `compose.yaml` will be used by the `docker compose engine` to bring up your services to live.
1. `compose_state.sh` is a helper script which contents a useful and rich set of options leading to give docker compose \
some instructions to rapidedly interact with your docker compose apps.
#
## Possible issue during the implementation
> If you face the below issue when trying to access your application via the browser `http://localhost:8000` or `http://host-ip:8000`,\
just remove and replace back the following variables as it worked for me: `ip=ip, date_now=date_now, time_now=time_now`\
I am not really sure of why this error may occure and if do know please raise a PR with an update on this `README.md`
